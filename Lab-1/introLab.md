## ENSE 352 - Fundamentals of Computer Systems Architectures - Lab

# Lab 1: Introduction to ARM and tools

### University of Regina
### Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science - Software Systems Engineering

### Lab Instructor: Cameron Oehler

This lab is adapted from materials created by Trevor Douglas

## Introduction

Introduce the students to some of the ARM architecture. Begin using the lab tools. The students will create a project and write an assembly program based on a simulated target.

## Background

### ARM Processor


- The Cortex-M3 processor is a high performance 32-bit processor designed for the microcontroller market. 
- Outstanding processing performance combined with fast interrupt handling
- Enhanced system debug with extensive breakpoint and trace capabilities.
- Efficient processor core, system and memories
- Ultra-low power consumption with integrated sleep mode and an optional deep sleep mode.

#### Stack pointer

Our Board has its FLASH memory  at address 0x08000000.

The Stack Pointer (SP) is register R13.  The stack is a region of RAM that is used for storing various information.  You can think of it like those yellow sticky notes you used to save notes or phone numbers on. On reset, the processor loads the SP with the value from address 0x08000000.


#### Program Counter

The Program Counter (PC) is register R15.  When you apply power to or reset your processor, it always reads  offset address 0x0x08000004 and puts the value it finds there into the PC.  This value MUST be a valid address pointing to the beginning of your code.

```assembly

;ARM1.s Source code for my first program on the ARM Cortex M3
;Function Modify some registers so we can observe the results in the debugger
;Author - Dave Duguid
;Modified August 2012 Trevor Douglas
; Directives

; Vector Table Mapped to Address 0 at Reset, Linker requires __Vectors to be exported
	AREA RESET, DATA, READONLY
	EXPORT 	__Vectors


__Vectors DCD 0x20002000 ; stack pointer value when stack is empty
	DCD Reset_Handler ; reset vector

Reset_Handler ;We only have one line of actual application code


	MOV R0, #0x76 ; Move the 8 bit Hex number 76



	ALIGN
		
	END
```
</details>


#### Program counter

The Program Counter (PC) is register R15. It contains the current program address. Bit[0] is always 0 because instruction fetches must be halfword aligned. On reset, the processor loads the PC with the value of the reset vector, which is at address 0x00000004.



#### Project Options
<table>
  <tr>
    <td> <img src="ProjectOptions.png"  alt="Project Options" width = 520px height = 400px ></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Notice that the ROM or Flash in our case is at 0x8000000 and the RAM is at 0x20000000.


#### Application Program Status Register

The APSR contains the current state of the condition flags from previous instruction executions. The bit assignments are:

#### Example instructions

in `example.s`

```assembly

label

  ;Move Data
  MOV	Ry, #0x76         ; Move a 8 bit Hex number to low word of Ry
  MOV	Ry, #0x7654       ; Move a 16 bit Hex number to low word of Ry
  MOVT	Ry, #0x7654     ; Move a 16 bit Hex number to high word of Ry
  MOV32	Ry, #0x76543210 ; Move the 32 bit Hex number to Ry
  MOV   Rx, Ry          ; Move Ry to Rx							

  ;Store Data. LDR allows to move 32 bits of data
  LDR	Ry, = 0x76543210  ;Load Ry with the 32 bit Hex number 76543210

  ;Arithmetic operations
  ADD	Rx,Ry,Rz    ; Add contents of Ry and Rz, store result in Rx
  ADDS	Rx,Ry,Rz  ; Sameâ€¦but there is a difference. What is it?	

  ;Branching
  B	label   		; Branch to  label


```
</details>

#### Things to Note
- The x,y,z in Rx, Ry, Rz are placeholders!  You may use any general purpose registers.
- Ox indicates a hexadecimal number.
- '#' indicates an immediate value.
- The MOV instruction copied data from register to register of from an immediate value.
- LDR is termed pseudo instruction.  This loads a 32 bit value into any register.
- Labels must be along the left margin and assembly code must be 1 tab in.
- Quick reference document available in the Resource folder on  URCourses.
